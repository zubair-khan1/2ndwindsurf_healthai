# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - Health Vault

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Setup Supabase First!

Your Supabase URL is still a placeholder. You MUST update it for Health Vault to work.

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Project URL

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Sign in or create account
3. Create a new project (or select existing)
4. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
5. Copy your **Project URL** (e.g., `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)

### Step 2: Update `.env.local`

Replace this line:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
```

With your actual URL:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-id.supabase.co
```

### Step 3: Run SQL Schema (Already Done ‚úÖ)

You mentioned you already ran the schema in SQL Editor. Great!

### Step 4: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
npm run dev
```
