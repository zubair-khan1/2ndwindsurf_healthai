# ✅ Health Vault Feature - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 What's Been Implemented

### **1. Family Member Categorization**
When users upload a health report, they are asked:
- **"Whose report is this?"**
- Options: Self, Father, Mother, Spouse, Son, Daughter, Brother, Sister, Other
- Optional name field for family members
- Data is saved with each report

### **2. Automatic Health Vault Saving**
- ✅ Every uploaded report is **automatically saved** to Supabase database
- ✅ Saved with family member information
- ✅ Linked to user's Clerk account (user_id)
- ✅ Includes full AI analysis text

### **3. Dashboard with Health Vault**
The dashboard now displays:
- **📊 Real-time stats**: Total reports, analyzed count, pending count
- **📂 Reports table** with columns:
  - Report Name
  - Family Member (color-coded badge)
  - Date
  - Status (Analyzed ✅)
  - Action (View button)
- **🔍 Family Filter**: Dropdown to filter reports by family member
- **🔐 Health Record Vault** showing:
  - Total reports count
  - Number of family members
  - Storage used (MB)
  - Breakdown by family member

### **4. Database Schema**
```sql
health_reports table:
├── id (UUID)
├── user_id (Clerk user ID)
├── file_name
├── file_size
├── file_type
├── analysis (AI-generated text)
├── family_member_name (e.g., "John", "Father", "Self")
├── relationship (e.g., "Father", "Mother", "Self")
├── created_at
└── updated_at
