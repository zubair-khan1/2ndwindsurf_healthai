# Fixes Applied - Summary

## üîß Three Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Subscription Reports Not Going to Admin
**Problem**: Admin dashboard wasn't showing subscription requests

**Solution**:
- Added `SubscriptionsTab` component at `/components/admin-subscriptions-tab.tsx`
- Imported component in admin dashboard
- Added "Subscriptions" tab button with Crown icon
- Fetches data from `/api/admin/subscriptions` endpoint
- Shows pending subscriptions with Approve/Reject buttons

**What Admin Can Do**:
- Go to `/admin` ‚Üí Click "Subscriptions" tab
- See all pending subscription requests
- View transaction IDs, user details, plan, amount
- Click "Approve" (turns green) or "Reject" (turns red)
- Approved subscriptions get 1-month validity

### 2. ‚úÖ Booking Status Showing After Logout
**Problem**: Booking banner was showing even when user logged out

**Solution**:
- Modified `fetchBookings()` in `/app/call-doctor/page.tsx`
- Added check for `Unauthorized` error response
- Sets `currentBooking` to `null` if user not logged in
- Banner only shows for authenticated users with active bookings

**Behavior Now**:
- Logged in user sees their booking banner
- After logout, banner disappears
- Only shows user's own bookings (not others')

### 3. ‚úÖ QR Code Not Showing
**Problem**: QR code image wasn't displaying on payment page

**Solution**:
- Changed from placeholder div to actual `<Image>` component
- Uses `src="/qr-code-payment.png"` from public folder
- Added proper Next.js Image import
- Displays QR code at 240x240px size

**Requirements**:
- Place your QR code image at `/public/qr-code-payment.png`
- Generate QR for UPI ID: `khnnabubakar786@paytm`
- Image will auto-display on payment page

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup Required

### Create Subscriptions Table (if not done):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subscriptions (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  plan TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
  transaction_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  upi_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  start_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  end_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_subscriptions_user_id ON subscriptions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_subscriptions_status ON subscriptions(status);
```
